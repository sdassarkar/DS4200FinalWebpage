    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">There are a few main takeaways from these visualizations. The first being that, in general, meat, fish, and
        eggs are the most expensive commodities. Referencing the treemap, some of the more expensive livestock include goats, sheep, and camels. Differences
        in prices across countries reflect geographic and situational differences properly (Goat is more expensive in Somalia than Mauritania, etc.).
        Another takeaway is that East Africa seems to be the most geographically affected region by food insecurity, as reflected by more orange and red on the heatmap.
        Of the East African nations, Somalia is most distressed with a significantly higher average commodity price than even neighboring countries. These are important observations
        and can be leveraged to address price issues amongst certain commodities and in certain areas.
